# 🎮 CreateToken Config for CS:GO / CS2  

This project provides a custom config file (`createtoken.cfg`) that can be executed inside **CS:GO / CS2** using the in-game console.  
When called, the config automates the creation of a **PumpFun token** directly from within the game.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- 🔹 Simple one-command execution with `exec_async`  
- 🔹 Automates PumpFun token creation  
- 🔹 Easy to install and reuse  
- 🔹 Keeps everything inside your CS:GO/CS2 workflow  

---

## 📂 Installation  

1. Download the [`createtoken.cfg`](./createtoken.cfg) file.  
2. Move it into your CS config folder:  

   ```bash
   .../Counter-Strike Global Offensive/game/csgo/cfg/

## ⚡ Usage

1. Launch CS2.

2. Open the developer console.

3. Run:

   ```bash
   exec_async createtoken

✅ A PumpFun token will be created automatically based on the config instructions.

---

## 🛠 Example  

 1.  
      ```bash
      exec_async createtoken

✅ Token created successfully on PumpFun 🎉

## 📌 Notes

Make sure your developer console is enabled in CS:GO/CS2.

This config is meant for automation/experimentation.

You can duplicate and edit createtoken.cfg to fit your custom setups.

## 🤝 Contributing

Pull requests are welcome! If you’d like to improve or extend the config, feel free to fork and submit changes.

Do you want me to also make a **minimal `createtoken.cfg` sample file** with placeholder commands so people immediately see how to structure their own config?
